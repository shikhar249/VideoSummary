Here is a combined summary:

The game show starts with a "super secret word" challenge, where viewers at home need to guess the word and if at least 100 people mention it in the comments, Josh will get dumped into the water. The first clue is given, which is the first letter of a country where Carmeria won a final, which is also the first letter of a country.

The show then transitions to a segment featuring contestants from different countries, including Romania and Nigeria, who are all competing against each other. Josh interacts with some of the contestants, discussing how they felt about the new cast and having to adjust their game plans.

The hosts tease some fun moments and interactions among the cast members, revealing that the audience can participate by answering polls and voting on which cast member they'd rather spend 24 hours with. The location for this season is Croatia, providing a beautiful backdrop for the show.

Later in the segment, Josh teases upcoming footage and reveals that he has two top-secret clips from the show. He chooses one clip over another, showing a fight, and hints at more drama to come. The cast is introduced, with some joking about their relationships and feuds. Josh also brings up cold temperatures in the studio, offering ice to the contestants to keep them comfortable.

The host discusses the unpredictability of the season's challenges and missions, then introduces the "shock game". The contestants receive joysticks with a button to press at the center when music stops. They must avoid being the first or last to press the button, as those who are will get shocked out of the game.

The game show has concluded and the host thanks the cast, Big G and Kyle for dialing in, and Josh for being a good sport. The audience is thanked for joining along the way. The host teases that they will be going to the jungle tomorrow to take Robert's interview, but doesn't provide more details about what this means.
